**Battleship**
==============


*Battleship is played on four grids, two for each player. The grids are square and the individual squares in the grid are identified by letter and number.  Before play begins, each player secretly arranges their ships on their primary grid. Each ship occupies a number of consecutive squares on the grid, arranged either horizontally or vertically. The number of squares for each ship is determined by the type of the ship.
After the ships have been positioned, the game proceeds in a series of rounds. In each round, each player takes a turn to announce a target square in the opponent's grid which is to be shot at. The opponent announces whether or not the square is occupied by a ship, and if it is a "hit" they mark this on their own primary grid. The attacking player notes the hit or miss on their own "tracking" grid, in order to build up a picture of the opponent's fleet.*


**Rules**
---------------

  1. Ships must be placed horizontally or vertically (never diagonally) across grid spaces, and can't hang over the outer grid boundary.

  2. Ships may be placed next to each other, but are not allowed to share a space with another ship.

  3. Players must arrange ships and record the shots made by their opponent on the lower grid, while recording their own shots on the upper grid.

  4. Players must take turns, with each player's turn consisting of announcing a target square in the opponent's grid which is to be shot at.

  5. If a ship occupies the square, the owner of the ship must announce a "hit." Likewise, if no ship occupies the square, the player must inform of a "miss."

  6. When all of the squares of a ship have been hit, the ship is sunk.

  7. Players must announce to their opponent each time one of their ships is sunk. (Example: "You sunk my Battleship!")

  8. The winner is the first player to sink their opponent's ships before all of their own are sunk.
